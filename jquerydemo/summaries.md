# Lesson 1
Summary:

1. $ is the same meaning as jQuery
2. use all the selectors and inside
$(document).ready(function(){
 otherwise those tags may not be found.
3. $(document).ready(function(){ //code}
    is the same as 
    $((function(){ //code})
    the second one is a shortcut for the first writing,
    basically same, while shorter and more common.
